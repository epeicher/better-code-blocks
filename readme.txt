Enhanced code block functionality for WordPress with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and copy functionality.

== Description ==

Better Code Blocks enhances the core WordPress Code block with additional features:

* Syntax highlighting using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
* Optional copy to clipboard button
* Optional title/header for code blocks
* Optional line numbers
* Unnecessary styling options and block supports are removed

This plugin is designed to be used with block themes that use the `theme-1`, `theme-2`, etc., naming convention for colors in `theme.json`. Examples include [Base](https://github.com/ndiego/base), [Kanso](https://github.com/richtabor/kanso), and the [Assembler](https://github.com/Automattic/themes/tree/trunk/assembler).
